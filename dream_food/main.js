Mak orders something called romo, but the girl working calls it romeo. Brian gets same thing without looking at what it is. When it comes out I see it is a drink with two layers. The base layer is a purple liquid with clear liquid on top, the purple liquid turns orange and Mak stirs it all together. I look at the menu and see that the romo is grape soda, sweetened condensed milk, and either seltzer or milk. It seems like a weird drink but is definitely the most unusual drink on the menu. I ask the girl behind the counter about it and she says that everyone has been ordering the romeo. I step back and think about what I want to get. I try a sip of Mak's and decide to get the romo.

I was with Tucker and I couldn't decide between a big or small pizza crust. Tucker goes and eats while I make my pizza. I pick a small crust and make a really good pizza with many toppings. I set my pizza down for a second and when I come back to it it is gone. There is a pizza face down on the ground near a group of RISD students. It must be my pizza but I am confused, because it doesn't look like it has the same toppings that I put on mine. I go back to the pizza bar and grab the last, undesirable crust to make a new one, right as they are about to close up for the night. They have mixed many of the toppings into a single tray so they could start cleaning up. I slap my pizza crust onto a mound of what looks like hummus and ranch. I grab the last few falafel and put those on top. A guy comes out to clean up but tells me to take my time once he sees that I am still making my pizza. There are very few toppings left so I say I'm almost done. He makes a strange analogy to the holocaust. He walks back to the kitchen and asks if I can shut the door behind him",

Next a sushi burger comes out. It is a patty of raw ground salmon on a bed of veggies. It is topped with wasabi and some sauce. There is a patty of rice on a separate plate. I say this looks good, and will myself to like it even though I don't like raw fish. I take a few bites and get up for one moment. When I comeback, both our plates of food have been removed. I walk over towards the other side of the restaurant, and think I see Timmy Ma sitting in what looks like a separate restaurant. I start to leave and Timmy calls out my name. I continue leaving and he calls out again. I walk over to say hello. Even though his voice sounds young, when he gets up to greet me he is giant. We briefly catch up, and he asks if I got the curry. I tell him I just got a classic burger because I didn't have a lot of time. I don't think the part of the restaurant we ate in actually served curry."
